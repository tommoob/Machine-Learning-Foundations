This repository is made up of various foundational machine learning projects designed as educational material. Each project should work independently.

Logistic regression:
This uses logistic_regression_tob.py and runs in the jupiter notebook: logistic_notebook.py

TODO currently broken by later code

Number classifier: 
This runs from MNIST-logistic.py, using MNIST_data_intake.py and logistic_regression_tob.py.

This uses the MNIST dataset to train a logistic regression model to classify written numbers. The path to the MNIST dataset must be changed in the __name__=__"main": function (currently line 119).
